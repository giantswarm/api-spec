          and is deprecated. It will still be accepted in requests until

              Specifies whether or not this cluster should run with redundant master
              nodes (high availability). When true, three master nodes will be started,
              each one in a different availability zone that is selected randomly.
              This is the recommended setting for production clusters. When false, only
              one master node will be created, also in a randomly selected availability
              zone.
